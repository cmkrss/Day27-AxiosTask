# React + Vite CRUD Application

## Overview

This React application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. It interacts with a mock API using Axios for fetching and manipulating user data.

Additionally, this project uses Vite for a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and linting support.

- Add new users.
- Edit existing user details.
